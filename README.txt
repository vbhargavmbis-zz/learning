Steps to compile:
(Once all files have been extracted and placed in one folder)
1. type "make" and press enter. This will compile the source codes and create an executable called "warmup1"
2. to execute: type "warmup1 sort" and press enter to give input from commandline
	    or type "warmup1 sort <test.tfile>" where test.tfile is the name of the file in tfile format in the folder
3. results will be displayed.


I have not made any design decisions or deviations from the specs.
